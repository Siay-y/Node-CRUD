# Project Description

This project is a Node.js API developed using TypeScript, aiming to provide endpoints for managing vehicles, including CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The project is structured into three main folders: `src` for routes, `services` for business logic, and `controllers` for application control layer.

## Key Features üöÄ

- **Vehicle CRUD:** The API allows creating, reading, updating, and deleting vehicles.
- **Structured Endpoints:** Endpoints are organized according to best practices, following a clear and cohesive structure.
- **TypeScript Development:** TypeScript enables safer and more consistent coding, with static typing and code autocompletion.
- **Data Persistence:** The project uses MongoDB as the database to store vehicle information.
- **Request Testing:** Insomnia is used to test and debug API HTTP requests, ensuring correct functionality.

## How to Use üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Install Dependencies:** Run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.
2. **Database Configuration:** Set up environment variables: Create a `.env` file at the project root and define the necessary environment variables, including the MongoDB Atlas connection URL.

Example: (MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-atlas-connection-url).
3. **Run the Server:** Execute `npm run dev` to start the server.
